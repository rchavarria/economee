This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

Scala application using Play 2.1 framework following this tutorial:
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaTodoList

Some learned play commands / way to do things:

- `play new <app name>`: creates a new application
- In play console: `run` runs the application
- file `conf/routes` defines all application's accesible URLs
- a class of our data model is defined using a `case class` plus some static methods
in an object of the same name. so, to define a data model class named `Task`, use:

	case class Task(id: Long, name: String)

	object Task {
		def all(): List[Task] = Nil // returns null
		//...
	}

- views are defined in .scala.html files, as templates. Lear about 
[Templating system](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaTemplates)
(it seems to be not very easy)
- [Form definitions and submissions](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaForms)
- One can config the database in `conf/application.conf` file
- [Evolutions (of database)](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/Evolutions)
- Using [Anorm](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaAnorm) to query the database
